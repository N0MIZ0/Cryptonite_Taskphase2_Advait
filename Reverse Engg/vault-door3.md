<br>
***Appraoching the challenge:***
The given JAVA code had a print statement at the end with a password 
(jU5t_a_sna_3lpm12g94c_u_4_m7ra41) but it was not the flag. <br>
After reading the code, I could conclude that the flag shall be of 32 characters length.
and the String which was alread given (jU5t_a_sna_3lpm12g94c_u_4_m7ra41) had to be rearranged according to the 4 *for* loops for the final password which shall *open* the vault and is also the flag.
