***Approaching the challenge:***
<br> The challenge description said how the flag is living in a particilar text file but the website is filtering out absolute paths. <br>
It was understanable that I had to use relative path of the text file to access the flag hence used 
```
././././flag.txt
```
But it didnt work, at the same time the first line of the website had **..** so instead I tried using 
```
../../../flag.txt
```
and it worked.
