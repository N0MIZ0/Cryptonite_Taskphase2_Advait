***Approaching the Challenge:*** <br>
I first typed snickerdoodle but nothing happened. <br>
Then opened the inspect page on the website and checked if there were any hidden comments. <br>
Checked if there was some *fishy* file at the source tab and moved on to cookies in the application tab. <br>
After opening cookies from storage, I had one cookie named "name" and value 0. <br>
I tried to change the name and reload the site but it didnt work instead just created another cookie. <br>
Then changed the values few times, and the text on the webpage changed to different types of cookies.
The console tab was empty/showing error.
No other leads.
