***Approaching the Challenge:*** <br>
After going through the material, it was clear that the provided file was a **pcapng**. <br>
PCAP is basically picture capture analysis, but not like steganography. <br>
PCAP is where network traffic can be stored. I proceeded downloading **wireshark** hoping I'll get the flag, but it had lots of data stored among which finding the flag was manually not practical. Tried viewing them in statistical view.
I then just went to different viewing options and checking the "netowork traffic" hoping to eye the flag.
