***Flag:*** <br>

***Approaching the Challenge:*** <br>
Since it was an audio file I tried decoding morse code but there wasnt any in it. <br>
I also checked it on Audacity for any audio waveforms as suggested by the manual but nothing.
I looked up the hints from which I concluded that the audio file is somehow connected to an image and the second hint was about choosing RX. <br>
After googling, concluded that the audio has to be decrypted via SSTV - SlowScan Television. <br>
Now to decrypt this I had to install QSSTV, but instead installed MMSSTV which is the same, but for windows. <br>
Converted the wav file to mmv and then played it. <br>
Found an image with the flag on it. <br>
