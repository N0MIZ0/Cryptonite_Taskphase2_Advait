***Approaching the Challenge:*** <br>
Since it was an audio file I tried decoding morse code but there wasnt any in it. <br>
I also checked it on Audacity for any audio waveforms as suggested by the manual but nothing.
I looked up the hints from which I concluded that the audio file is somehow connected to an image and the second hint was about choosing RX. <br>
After googling, concluded that the audio has to be decrypted via SSTV - SlowScan Television. <br>
Now to decrypt this I had to install QSSTV, but instead installed MMSSTV which is the same, but for windows. <br>
Trying to convert the wav file to mmv so that I can play it on the software. <br>
MMSSTV was not working properly, I could not find the right way to set it up. So instead used QSSTV from someone who had it installed.
