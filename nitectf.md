**BackTrack (OSINT)**:<br>
Went to the Japanese tokyo website and figured out which metro line was the challenge related to and they also had a seperate archive for the delayed trains. But it showed only the details of previous 90 days. <br> Hence copied that page link and used the wayback machine to search
for delayed trains in that particular line that year, found the flag.
